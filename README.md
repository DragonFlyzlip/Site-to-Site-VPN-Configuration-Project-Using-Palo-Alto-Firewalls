# Site-to-Site-VPN-Configuration-Project-Using-Palo-Alto-Firewalls

## Objective

The objective of this project is to gain hands-on experience in configuring a site-to-site VPN using Palo Alto firewalls, a critical skill for anyone working in network security. By setting up and managing secure VPN tunnels, the project allows you to understand how to securely connect different networks over the internet, ensuring that sensitive data can be transmitted safely between locations. Youâ€™ll learn to configure Palo Alto firewall interfaces, virtual routers, zones, NAT policies, and IPSec VPN tunnels, all of which are essential elements in establishing a reliable and secure network architecture. Completing this project not only builds technical proficiency but also enhances your ability to troubleshoot and manage complex network security setups, which is invaluable for both security professionals and network administrators. Through this hands-on approach, you'll develop a deep understanding of VPN technology and how to implement it to safeguard communications across distributed networks.
